# Cyberpunk Memory Game

## About the Project

Welcome to a simple yet electrifying twist on the classic card game of memory! This project is a cyberpunk-themed version of the timeless memory game, where players match pairs of cyberpunk characters. The entire game was built in just one hour, with a self-imposed challenge to create a fully functional game without using any pre-built engines or starting assets.

## The Challenge

The goal was straightforward but ambitious: to design, code, and test a complete memory game within one hour. From gathering assets to styling the game and writing all the code, every element of this project was created from scratch. No pre-existing assets, code snippets, or scripts were allowed at the start, making this a true test of speed, creativity, and problem-solving under pressure.

## Gameplay

The game itself follows the classic rules of memory. Players flip over two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. But in this version, the cards are populated with cyberpunk-themed characters, giving the game a futuristic, neon-lit vibe that stands out from the usual fare.

## What You'll Find Here

In this repository, you’ll find all the source code and assets used to create the game. The code is straightforward and easy to follow, making it an excellent resource for beginners who want to learn the basics of game development, even without the use of a game engine.

## Final Thoughts

This project was a blast to create, and I hope it can be a helpful and inspiring resource for other developers. Whether you’re just starting out or looking for a quick challenge of your own, feel free to dive into the code, experiment with it, and maybe even add your own unique twists.
